          Photography, as we know it today, began in the late 1830s in France. Joseph Nicéphore Niépce used a portable camera obscura to expose a pewter plate coated with bitumen to light. This is the first recorded image that did not fade quickly.
Niépce's success led to a number of other experiments and photography progressed very rapidly. Daguerreotypes, emulsion plates, and wet plates were developed almost simultaneously in the mid- to late-1800s.
With each type of emulsion, photographers experimented with different chemicals and techniques. The following are the three that were instrumental in the development of modern photography. Below are the places around the world in which I drew my insperation from.

          Why Is photography my passion? It's the vivid illustration of a memory that lasts forever and reminds you of the good old days that sometimes pass before you can even blink. A photo lets us use our imagination and transform our feelings, moods, and ideas into something palpable no matter what passions and professional backgrounds we have.
